"BUGS"

The goal of the game is to surround your opponent's Queen Bee with pieces. All pieces are hexagons, and are played next to each other. Each player starts with the following pieces: 
1 Queen Bee
3 Ants 
3 Grasshoppers
2 Spiders
2 Beetles 


Play starts with one player putting a piece on the board, then their opponent puts a piece next to it. On following turns, players can either move an existing piece or play a new piece. If a player plays a new piece, it must be only touching their existing pieces. The queen Bee must be played by turn 4. 
Movement rules: 
1. The Queen Bee can only move 1 space per turn. 
2. Beetles can move one space per turn but can also move on top of the hive. A piece with a beetle on top of it cannot move, and the stack takes on the color of the Beelte.
3. The grasshopper jumps at least 1 piece to get to a different square. 
4. The spider must move exactly 3 spaces per turn
5. The ant can move to any position on the board 

The following rules must ALWAYS be followed. 
1. The pieces in play must be linked at all times. You can never leave a piece stranded or separate the hive in 2. 
2. Pieces can only move in sliding movements. If a piece is surrounded to the point that it can no longer physically slide out of its position, it can't be moved.
